# LesionXAI â€“ Lesion-Aware Visual Explanation for Apple Leaf Disease Detection

This project uses **Grad-CAM** over a pre-trained **ResNet50** model to generate visual explanations for apple leaf disease classification. It compares these visual outputs with annotated lesion masks using the **Intersection over Union (IoU)** metric to evaluate alignment and model interpretability.

> Built as part of the **Neurostack Internship Task 2025**.
